# Google Street View Album

## Problem:
* I love [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) as a very useful tool for browsing through collections of Google Street View snapshots. For instance, I created a personal geoguessr for places in my past that are important to me, that I like to use to show friends around my life.
* There are some constraints - Geoguessr isn't really *made* to create Google Street View *albums*, per se:
    * You can only get 5 map snapshots every time you play a Geoguessr game.
    * If you only want to browse through locations and don't feel like *playing Geoguessr*, you still have to do the annoying thing of selecting arbitrary points on the map to move on to the next stage.
    * I notice that if you play a map multiple times, Geoguessr seems to like showing you some locations more than others, which means you repeat locations quite often. I'm not sure why, and would prefer a bias towards locations I haven't seen recently for this use case.
* Some Geoguessr features I do like:
    * I do like that Geoguessr randomizes the order in which you see locations, which is a nice touch!
    * Being able to export your geoguessr map as lat-long coordinates is extremely useful.

## Idea:
* To solve my SPECIFIC problem I want a Geoguessr -> Google Street View album data integration.
    * A simple idea: Site where you upload the Geoguessr CSV and get a little randomized carousel of Maps iframes to flick through.
        * Sounds extremely doable.
* The general / broader idea:
    * I wish there was an easy way to create Google Street View albums / sharable collections / tours meant to send to friends and show around. Like a little time capsule of, "look at some places important to me". As far as I can tell, this doesn't exist yet?
        * And if it does exist, it might cost a lot / be extremely un Google-able right now?
    * If it existed, I can imagine additional features like:
        * Annotating images and pictures on the virtual 'tour' (e.g. "Here's a park I went to as a kid when I wanted space to think!" or "Here's where I went on a first date!")
        * Controlling privacy access to a specific album / tour
        * Multiple editors on maps / albums to create shared experiences
        * Maybe allowing people to program in a specific 'walking route' on Google Maps that has built in captions / annotations to describe what is going on around them and show someone around their neighborhood / their world?
            * I'd find it really cool to be able to view other peoples' 'walking tours' describing their neighborhoods, overlaid on Maps.
* The even broader SPIRIT of the idea is that, Street View seems underexploited as a way to:
    * Foster human connection
    * Help people 'peek into each others worlds' a little bit more
    * Explore a new area in a more enriching way
    * I'm sure the Street View PMs have more ideas along these veins
